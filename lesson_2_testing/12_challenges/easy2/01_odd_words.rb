Odd Words and the How to Work with a Code Challenge

We did a live problem solving session and used the "Odd Words" problem to
talk about the general process of working through a live code challenge.

Unlike other challenges, this one doesn't come with a complete test suite,
so you have to work out your own examples(you don't have to write the
actual tests, just example inputs and outputs). You can watch the first
10 minutes of the video on the general process and the problem itself,
try to work on the problem, and fast foward to 47:20 or so when we discuss
the solutions.

problem:
consider a character set consisting of letters, a space, and a point
Words consist of one or more, but at most 20 letters. An input text
consists of one or more words sperated from each other by one or more
spaces and terminated by 0 or more spaces followed by a point. The input
should be read from, and including, the first letter of the first word,
up to and including the terminating point. The output text is to be
produced such that succesive words are seperated by a single space with
the last word being terminiated by a single point. Odd words are copied
in reverse order while even words are merely echoed. For example, the
input string
'whats the matter with kansas.' becomes 'whats eht matter htiw kansas.'

bonus points: the characters must be read and printed one at a time.
